<p>This guide will show you how to set up Github Pages for your own website or blog.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> is an extremely useful site for storing repositories of code. You can use it
    to showcase your project, or to collaborate on a project with others. Github Pages will create a repository that
    allows you to host it directly on the web. You can even attach a domain name of your choosing or you can use the one
    assigned which would be: <code>username.github.io</code> but this option will be completely free.</p>

<h2>Setting up Github Pages from scratch</h2>

<p>This option starts from scratch but is very simple. You will first need a Github account if you do not already have
    one. Keep in mind that your username will be attached to your site and will be public listed with all of your
    repositories. Choose something you will not regret. You can create an account at <a
        href="https://github.com">Github.com</a> by selecting the sign up button and following the prompts. You can do
    all of this with the free plan.</p>

<p>Next you will want to click the <code>Start a Project</code> button. When you name your project, make sure that you
    name it <code>USERNAME.github.io</code> replacing USERNAME with your actual username. This will tell Github to
    create a special webpage project that will push your files to that URL whenever there is a change. Make sure that
    you have selected the public option. You may also check the box to add a README file. This will not show anywhere on
    your webpage but it is a way to show those that come to your repository what your project is about.</p>

<p>From your repositories page, there will be a drop down menu named <code>Add file</code> in the top right. CLick then
    and select create new file. Name the file <code>index.html</code> then copy the following code into your
    file.</p>

<p>Once you save this file you will click the settings tab above your repository. Then on the left side of the screen,
    under the Code and Automation section, click Pages. Under the Source section, verify that Branch: main is in the
    first drop-down and /root is in the second. Now above that should be a green box that says your site is published.
    Clicking the link will take you to your webpage.</p>

<p> <em><strong>CONGRATULATIONS!</strong></em> Your website is now up and running. Now you can use HTML and css to
    create a website. Or on the Pages settings screen, you can click the Theme button and
    choose a premade theme to make it easier for you.</p>
