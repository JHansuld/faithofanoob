<h2>This is my First Post!</h2>

<p>I have begun the journey into tech, specifically into web development. Many have taken this journey and I have found
    numerous blogs, podcosts and videos that talk about these journeys. One thing that I noticed with these stories is
    that most of them had some sort of help. Many of them talk about having a degree. Some others talk about getting a
    job at a tech company or close to the IT
    department of a non-tech company. Another common one that I came across was that they quit their job to do a
    bootcamp or study at home or even get a degree in tech.</p>

<p>I do not have this advantage. I am 35 years old, and in the military as an aircraft mechanic. I have hit a point in
    which I am tired of working out in the weather. I am tired of the deployments and the long hours. I need a change. I
    could go to school for four years but from what I read, I can teach myself and get into a new job within a year. I
    figured I would document my journey to encourage others that can't just quit their job and feel like this path is
    something they cannot do.</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The plan is to make a blog post a day about my journey as a journal entry. This will also be part of my
        #100dayofcode journey.</li>
    <li>There will also be instructional posts for items that I come across with issues. Some of the instructional info
        I have found is either too advanced or was created years ago and is out of date.</li>
    <li>There will also be posts to review resources I have used and to recommend strategies and tips about how to use
        some of the resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Info</h2>

<p>This section is going to list the info for the beginning of my journey that might be different than others.</p>

<ol>
    <li>I am using a Lenovo Flex 14 that I wiped of windows and installed Ubuntu 20.04.3 that will be used solely for my
        coding journey.</li>
    <li>I have a desktop for everything else that I have been using to watch videos and find info while I code on the
        laptop.</li>
    <li>I work Monday-Friday, 9 hours a day. Currently working the night shift. This means that the military has me
        switch my hours randomly to fit their needs and do dayshift atleast once every two weeks.</li>
    <li>I am fulltime with the Air National Guard, this does mean that one weekend a month I am required to work during
        the dayshift. </li>
    <li>I have two boys that live two hours away. They are part of the reason for this journey because I want to move
        closer to them.</li>
    <li>I have a <a href="https://canineweekly.com/long-haired-german-shepherd/">Long Haired German Shepherd</a> named
        <a href="/images/alphonse1.jpeg">Alphonse</a>. He is full of energy and requires regular exercise. This will
        take away from coding time but will also
        make sure I stay active and take the all important breaks from long sessions.
