<p>Today I got a good 4 hours in. Mostly researching. I learned how to install ruby and Jekyll on my laptop. Then I went
    through the process of setting up my blog with Jekyll. I still do not know all of it but I am learning. Jekyll
    allows for the use of <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">markdown</a> to be used in place of HTML for my posts
    but I have opted out of that
    and will continue using HTML. I personally see markdown as more useful for someone that wants just a quick blog or
    is not very technical. This blog is suppose to be a learning tool for me to improve my HTML, CSS, and Javascript
    skills.</p>

<p>I have a long way to go on the site, tomorrow I will focus on setting up the CSS side of things. I will also set up
    navigation to be better in the site by adding a category link and allowing sorting by date or by tag. I may make a
    todo list on the homepage to help keep me accountable.</p>
