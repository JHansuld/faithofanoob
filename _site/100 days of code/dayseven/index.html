<p>Today I focused on getting my blog finished. It took a while but I needed a slow day. Work canceled so I had the day
    off and used it to relax and get back in the right headspace. <a href="/images/alphonse1.jpeg">Alphonse</a> was a
    huge fan of this idea and extremely supportive. I found a tech podcast a while back that I enjoy called <a
        href="https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/">Learn to Code with Me</a> by Laurence Bradford. I have been listening
    to it when I can't actually get to coding and on my rides to and from work. She interviews individuals in the tech
    field and pulls valuable advice from them. Listening to this podcast is when I put together how often people say
    they taught themselves to code and got a great job actually mean that they taught themselves enough code to do
    something and used their degree to get a job that helped them learn more and start a tech company.</p>

<p>So today my coding has been listening to this and finding new resources for freelancing. I do not think freelancing
    is a longterm solution for me, but I do believe that I can use it to force myself to learn more by doing it because
    it forces a deadline and puts my reputation and money on the line if I fail. As I am learning on my own, I do not
    really have the time crunch of deadlines except the ones I set myself and sometimes those can be hard to keep. My
    odd rotating hours and hectic life can be a real motivator to "do it tomorrow" instead of buckling down and getting
    something done.</p>

<p>Before I started the 100 Days of Code challenge, I was using <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin
        Project</a> and Colt Steele's Udemy course, <a
        href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp">The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022</a> ,as my
    learning completely. I still plan to use them but the blog was a necassary distraction for me. When I used these, I
    followed the Odin project until I got stuck, and then I would watch the videos on Udemy. So today I went back and
    did the projects and examples on Udemy as something easy that just helps enforce the knowledge I have gained.</p>
