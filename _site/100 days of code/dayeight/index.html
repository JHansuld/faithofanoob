<p>Today was a day of reflection but not by choice. I had to go into work early today so my study time before work was
    cut short. This must be the bit in all the commercials I see mentioning that working adults need a flexible
    schedule. I spent my freetime at work going over articles from <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin
        Project</a> that I had marked previously to reread. From my time working on The Odin Project, I can tell you
    that it is rough at times. It mostly sends you off to read articles that others have written, articles that are of
    immense help. Essentially, they have gathered the resources that someone who is new and learning is looking for, and
    handed it to us. They do explain things briefly, and by no means are there no other resources that you can find out
    there that are top-notch. </p>

<p>Often times I would save articles into folders on my phone. I have a homepage on my Galaxy phone that is dedicated to
    code and learning. It has two folders for The Odin Project pages I save. One is for pages that I find the most
    helpful. Mostly ones that I want to have as recommendations for later, and another folder for pages that had
    concepts that I found difficult and wanted to revisit after pushing forward a bit more.</p>

<p>Self teaching coding seems to be one giant test. I feel like each step is a test
    question that I need to get right in order to get a good grade, or in this case, a good job. I can change my answers
    as much as I need to and in this test, I can even change the questions. Maybe it is normal for people learning to
    make a landing page, but instead I make a blog page. The point to this is that during every test I ever took, in
    school or in the military, they always say that if you do not know the answer right away that you should come back
    to it at the end of the test.</p>

<p>Having articles for the sections I find most difficult is helpful to me because sometimes learning the next step
    fills in some of the blanks and helps me understand the next time that I read it. If I read it again and still do
    not understand, then I use the link in the folder as a reminder to find even more sources to help me understand
    until I do get it.</p>

<h2>Where I am At</h2>

<p>This probably should have been in the first post but I feel like I should post where I am learning and my progress
    within those sources. This way it let's any of you reading know how far I am if you want to follow along with my
    path or compare my progress with your own. I should probably mention that I am in no way affiliated with any of the
    following links. If that changes, then I will let you know because I would definitly not turn down money to
    recommend what I already think is a fantastic resource.</p>

<h4>- 85% through Foundations</h4>

<p>Curruently in the foundations section of the course. I have just finished the DOM manipulation section and pegun the
    Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors section. Once this is done I will have two projects, on more fundamentals lesson and
    two back end intro sections before I choose a path. The DOM manipulation has proven to be the hardest thing for me
    to understand. That is where I felt like I hit a wall. The blog has definitly helped me here but I need to find more
    information on it.</p>

        2022</a></h3>

<h4>- Section 26 of 60</h4>

<p>This is where I started. I really enjoy his videos on this course and I feel like he is talking to me more of a
    student helping another student instead of a professor just spouting information. The course was very highly
    recommended on Reddit. After I got to the Javascript section, I started The Odin Project. My strategy now is to use
    this when I get stuck and then to continue where I left off on this course until I get through the spot
    that has me stuck.</p>

<p>I did pay for this course, it is not free. I did get the course on discount and only got it because I paid $14 for
    it. It is worth what he charges but if you want it, you could start with The Odin Project until this goes on sale.

<h4>- Responsive Web Design</h4>

<p>I have finished all of the lessons in this section and have finished the Tribute Page project. Four more to go and I
    can move to the next course. This was a fun and fairly easy section. I will probably finish these projects within
    the next week or two. The project I did was a good starting point, and for an automated grading system it does a
    great job. I tried to make the page look good, but that is not a requirement for the program to pass you. </p>

<p>I heard about this one from the podcast Learn to Code with Me. They mention it a lot. It is good, and I do recommend
    it, but I feel like it is just a supplimental resource and not a good stand alone resource.</p>

<h3>&#8226 <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a></h3>

<p>I know this seems obvious but this has been one of the best resources for me when I didn't know where to start and
    anytime I got stuck. I know there are other websites like Stack overflow but I used that site maybe twice. The one
    time I remember using it to find something, the answer was in the comments and it felt like I didn't really learn
    anything. Maybe that is not the norm there, but on Reddit, I usually find a link to an article that helps me
    understand where I went wrong. There are numerous subreddits that I have used here, but I usually search the whole
    site for my issue and pick the closest matching post title. I will make a post about resources later with specific
    subreddits in it.</p>

<h3>&#8226 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web">Mozilla Developer Network</a></h3>

<p>My favorite resource for documentation. W3Schools has good info as well, but I prefer the asthetics of this site.
    Otherwise the info seems the same. I know it is a weird reason to choose which one to prefer, but I am an unusual
    guy.</p>

<h3>&#8226 <a href="https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/"></a>Learn to Code with Me</h3>

<p>This podcast keeps me focused on my journey while giving me a break from all of the coding and technical bits. There
    is mostly advice on how to use your time to generate leads for freelancing or for job recommendations but they also
    mention resources for learning. My main takeaway here is that it is motivational for me to hear the success stories.

<h2>Key takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>When you get stuck on a concept, write it down or save a link to it and come back to it later</li>
    <li>You can rewrite the questions, make projects that are not on typical lists for newbies</li>
    <li>If a program does not work for you, find one that does and save the old one to supplement difficult ideas</li>
    <li>Just because a resource is considered the "best" does not mean it is the only resource</li>
</ul>
