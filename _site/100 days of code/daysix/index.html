<p>This day I spent building the homepage css. It took me a while. I also did it 3 times and got frustrated. So I took a
    walk with <a href="/images/alphonse1.jpeg">Alphonse</a>. I decided that I am going to start off with a theme. I need
    to not focus on the details as much at the moment. The most important thing is to get the blog up and running and
    get back to focusing on studying. The experience of building my own blog as a project is good but I am stressing
    over the details currently. I will tinker with the site when I have spare time and need a break because I get stuck,
    but it will take time.</p>

<p>Using a theme for Jekyll came with it's own hurdles. I was able to get it installed, but was very quickly overwhelmed
    by trying to figure out how it formatted things. The theme that I chose was <a
        href="https://github.io/mmistakes/so-simple-theme">So Simple Theme</a> by <a
        href="https://twitter.com/mmistakes">Michael Rose</a>. My main issue was I ran into issues with the posts I had
    up. Everytime I cliked a post it took me to my latest post instead of the one that I clicked one. I struggled with
    this one for a while until I had to go to work.</p>

<p>When I got home I sat down and was very much exhausted from work. Going to work on the blog sounded awful and I had
    no desire to do anything. I decided to get a the new Pokemon game. <em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em>. So I booted up
    my Switch and began downloading the updates because I have not played it in a long time. prepped my lunch, and then
    started downloading the game. I promise my goal is not to tell you every little detail of my life, this is just to
    show how I went from not being willing to work on my project to telling myself that I can work on it for the time it
    would take to download the game.</p>

<p>So I sat down and started going through the code on the theme's github. I found the docs folder with a theme-setup.md
    file. This file is a step by step of customizing the site and following this and the files in the examples folder
    showed me where my mistake was. I had added the front matter to my site based on the read me file and they were not
    the same as those in the example files and the document files. Upon changing this everything just worked.</p>

<p>I have read that in coding, and in life, if you are struggling and cannot get focused then you need to give yourself
    a small victory or two will help you get back on track by increasing you general mood. Well it works. I spent the
    next three hours working on my site.</p>

<p>When I took my dog for a walk, it was a good distraction and help me get more energy. However, that is not always
    enough and when I finally solved a dificult problem, it made all the other problems just flow. I know it is not
    directly about coding but I think that the information I learned today with this will help me be a better programmer
    in the future. Most importantly though, it will make me a better student and help me stay on track.</p>

<h2>Key takeaways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Take breaks regularly</li>
    <li>Find something distracting and fun</li>
    <li>Have quick, easy projects lined up for a victory when you hit a wall</li>
    <li>Do not let perfecting the small details destract you from getting your project done</li>
</ul>
