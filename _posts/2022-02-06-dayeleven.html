<p>Today was a a busy day, designing a landing page for <a href="https://freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a>. My page can
    be found <a href="https://codepen.io/jhansuld/pen/ZEaLoJV">at this link</a>. I had so much fun with this one. I love
    the
    colors of this. I always wanted to own a tea shop or a bookstore when I was younger, and this would be the tea shop
    for me. Styling the form section came to be the most difficult for me. I ended up leaving it very basic. I have this
    one saved on my laptop and I may run this as a little side project later when I have more time. It may help to learn
    more about javascript with users having logins, and secure transactions.</p>

<p>Side projects is what everyone says to do for practice and to add to your portfolio to get hired, but all of the
    recommended projects are exactly the same. I am sure that the people doing the hiring get sick of comparing the same
    projects. I have been racking my brain trying to come up with some off the wall ideas that might work but have not
    yet. Maybe running a side business might be the advantage I need?</p>

<p>Another update that I have is that I was able to send a few emails to non-profits around the area to see if they need
    any assistance. Now I just need to wait and see how they respond. I am excited to find an opertunity to do some good
    in my community using tech skills. I have contributed my time to passing out food and clothing. It feels like
    something is missing though and I assume that it is because anyone can do that. I want to contribute something
    unique, something that helps in the long term.</p>

<p>This weekend I will hopefully have a chance to put out another guide as well. I also need to find out how to set up
    SEO on my blog. It has come to my attention that you cannot find my blog from google at all. I thought I had the SEO
    set up so I am going to have to do a lot more research to figure that out.</p>
