<p>Today I worked on the Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors lesson on The Odin Project. It is a lot easier this time around,
    though still tough. Not much new here. I did get into the code though. The main takeaway for today was from the
    episode of <a href="https://learntocodewith.me/">Learn to Code with Me</a> that I listened to today. Season 1
    Episode 9 with <a href="https://twitter.com/bexrefford">Becca Refford</a> where she discusses what it is like
    learning without the aid of school. Now she did get a job shortly after leaving college, but she talks a lot about
    taking as many of the projects that you can in order to get as much experience that you can.</p>

<p>I have considered freelancing projects when I have enough knowledge to do so. My biggest issue here is not knowing
    how much to charge. I have made a website for someone that I work with, but I used Wordpress and feel like it is not
    that great. I may try to get some work from local businesses here in a few months, or maybe sooner.</p>

<p>She mentions networking by volunteering your skills and I feel like this would be a great way to get my name out
    there while learning. This may help with the lack of group work that comes with solo learning. I have to work this
    weekend but I do plan on looking for local communities that I may be able to help with and contact them about
    possible projects I could help with. I already found a meet up group on Facebook that is around where I want to live
    and one of my goal locations for work. They focus on comming up with ideas on how to bring the community around into
    the more technical era. I am excited for the first zoom call with them to find out more about what they are.</p>

<p>This strategy is similar to the idea behind my blog. I may not know exactly how I can do it, and I may not be great
    at it, but I will get it done and I will improve.</p>

<p>Becca's biggest recommendation is to make a goal that is geared toward finishing a project instead of focusing so
    much on following a linear approach to learning. I will still follow those linear steps on the programs I have but I
    do need a goal. My first goal will be to find a volunteer project.</p>

<p>I know that this was a short post and not very informative, but I have to cut this one short. I will go more indepth
    with my goals and this new group when I figure more of it out. Hopefully within the next two days.</p>
