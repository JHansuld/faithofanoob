<p>I have looked into a lot of info on SEO and Google analytics. I wish there was more troubleshooting options. It would
    be nice if Google analytics would have a ping options where you could verify it was able to work without just
    waiting and finding out.</p>

<p>Most of my time has been to this since work has picked up a lot this week. Reading articles and listening to podcasts
    is all I can do at work, but it is better than nothing I suppose. I did have an idea for a side project that might
    help me get better. I play a game called <a href="">Shop Titans</a> for mobile and PC. It is a game where you make
    items to sell in your shop, but the only player to player interaction is a guild, which you share levels for
    resource gathering, and selling to other players on the market. There is a bit of strategy involved, but as I have
    progressed I have tried to find tips for different things. The only guides available are recent ones that are
    generic in saying, make items and sell them. The other option is old outdated guides that have not been kept up
    with.</p>

<p>The most recommended site to use is <a href="">ST-Central</a> but it's guides are all from the original owner and
    have not been updated in a long time. This is not a huge deal for those of us that have been progressing a ways in
    before looking for guides because we can spot the issues, but new players may take the wrong path for ascension and
    shop set up and such because they do not know the difference. The only thing they do update is the news section
    which is just telling people when new features are added.</p>

<p>I know it is a silly game, but I think I might actually be able to help people to enjoy their experience better. A
    few of my guildmates have discussed it with me and we may work together to get it started. I am pretty excited about
    this one.</p>
