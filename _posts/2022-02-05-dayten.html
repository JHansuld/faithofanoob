<p>Today was a simple project for <a href="https://freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a>. I designed a Survey Form. Having
    done some practice with
    forms in HTML already, this project was fairly straight forward. I really enjoy how the <a
        href="https://codepen.io">Codepen</a>
    environment they use has a simple built in grader for the project. The grade is extremely simple, mostly just
    checking that I have an element with a certain <code>class</code> or <code>class</code> tag. I am enjoying that it
    acts like a checklist for what I need to have, but gives me the freedom to work with it to display it the way that I
    want.</p>

<p>At this stage, I really enjoy designing the pages in CSS. I am not great at it and constantly have to look up things.
    It takes more time than any of the HTML does because I have to guess and check. It makes me wonder if the is a
    quicker way of desinging a webpage without using something like Wix or Wordpress to make it visual. I may see if
    there are some projects that need CSS done on Github or Reddit and see if I can get some more practice with it. </p>

<p>A quick google to see how many programs would come up, show me a bunch of articles that say I need to practice and
    learn fundimentals to get better at CSS. That was what I figured. My goal with CSS is to focus on deciding when ID
    tags are better than Class tags. Knowing how to group elements to take advantage of CSS code to hit more targets
    seems to save a lot of time.</p>
